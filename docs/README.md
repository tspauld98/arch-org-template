# Overview

## Template Introduction

***This file is the main documentation file (`docs/README.md`) for the site. Regardless of your documentation structure, this file should always exist.***

This site contains the sample artifacts for the architecture organizer template project.  If you'd like to use this template for your own project, you can [fork it](https://github.com/tspauld98/arch-organizer-template/fork) or [create a new repository from it](https://github.com/new?template_name=arch-organizer-template).  You can also [view the source code](https://github.com/tspauld98/arch-organizer-template) for this site.  It is set up so that the site's content is in the `docs` folder.  Once you have set up this template in your own repository, make changes to any Markdown files in the `docs` folder to replace this documentation with your documentation for your project.  After making your changes, you can test it locally with the `docsify` command or host it on compatible services.  If you are using Github Pages, you can set the source for your site to be the `docs` folder in the `main` branch.

***Detailed instructions for using this template can be found [here](https://github.com/tspauld98/arch-organizer-template) in the `README.md` file.***

The **Template Introduction** section can be deleted when you customize this site for your own project.
