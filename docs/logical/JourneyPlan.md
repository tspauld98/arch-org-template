# Journey Plan

## Purpose

The journey plan is a plan that shows the order that features of the system will be developed and delivered.  It is similar to a roadmap but without timing or resourcing.  It's primarily used to articulate the order of work required to deliver each interim state release on the journey to the target-state solution.  In additition to the order of work, it also outlines the critical business value each interim state release is expected to deliver.  The journey plan is intended to brief business stakeholders and technical leadership.  The artifacts in the journey plan are at the `kite` level of abstraction.
