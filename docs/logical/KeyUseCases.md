# Key Use Cases

## Purpose

The key use cases for the solution are the core high-level use cases that, when implemented, will solve the business problem at hand.  The reason for separating these use cases out from the Use Case Inventory artifact that appears in the `Deployment` section of this organizer is to highlight their critical nature and to summarize the business value that the solution is expected to deliver.  These use cases are used to "test" the target-state solution to ensure that it is capable of delivering the expected business value.  The Representative Sequence Diagrams artifact which appears later this section of the organizer is used to demonstrate how these use cases exercise the functionality of the target-state solution.

The high-level use case diagram is a visual representation of the key use cases and their relationships to each other.  This diagram is used to communicate the high-level functionality of the solution to business stakeholders and technical leadership.  The additional information table following the diagram adds additional context for each use case and provides a serial number to reference the use case from other artifacts.  Use cases in the Use Case Inventory artifact in the `Deployment` section of this organizer are specializations of these key use cases and should reference the serial numbers of their related key use case.

## Electivity

This artifact is considered:  **Mandatory**

## High-Level Use Case Diagram

In addition to the illustration below, occasionally a textual description of the use cases from the diagram is useful for clarifying what the solution is solving.
