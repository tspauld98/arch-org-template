# Capability Map

## Purpose

A capability map, sometimes referred to as a feature map or city map, is a diagram that shows the current and future capabilities of the system. The capabilities are decomposed as a layer or block diagram where the outermost container is the problem domain and the innermost blocks are lower-level features. The capabilities in a capability map help decompose the problem domain into manageable pieces that can be developed and delivered incrementally priortized by business value.
