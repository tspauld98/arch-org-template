# Activity Diagrams

## Purpose

## More Information on Activity Diagrams

While activity diagrams can be critical to understand how a system works, they are often not necessary for every system.  The decision to include activity diagrams should be based on the complexity of the system and the need to understand the flow of control by developers.  If the system is simple and the flow of control is obvious, then activity diagrams may not be necessary.  For more information on activity diagrams, see the [UML Activity Diagrams](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/activity-diagrams.html) page.  Mermaid does not currently support activity diagrams, so they will need to be created using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) or a similar tool.
