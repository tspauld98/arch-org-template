# State Diagrams

## Purpose

The purpose of state diagrams is to describe the behavior of a system in response to external stimuli/events by illustrating how the state of key entities changes with each stimulus/event.  The state diagrams are intended to describe in detail how the state of key entities in the target-state solution changes based on specific events to provide additional clarity on business logic and data structure for developers.  The artifacts in the state diagrams are at the `fish` level of abstraction.

## More Information on Activity Diagrams

While state diagrams can be critical to understand how a system works, they are often not necessary for every system.  The decision to include state diagrams should be based on the complexity of the lifecycle of key entities and the need to understand how the state of those entities transitions through stages.  If the system is simple and all state transitions are obvious, then state diagrams may not be necessary.  For more information on state diagrams, see the [UML State Diagrams](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/state-machine-diagrams.html) page.  Both Mermaid and Lucidchart support state diagrams.
