# Sequence Diagrams

## Purpose

The purpose of sequence diagrams is to illustrate the interactions between classes and components of the target-state solution for variations of use cases.  These diagrams are used to specify interactions for key interfaces in the design and they differ from representative sequence diagrams in their altitude.  The sequence diagrams in this artifact provide clear and explicit direction to developers on the order of operations and interactions.  The artifacts in the sequence diagrams are at the `fish` level of abstraction.

## More Information on Activity Diagrams

While sequence diagrams can be critical to understand how a system works, they are often not necessary for every system.  The decision to include sequence diagrams should be based on the complexity of the system and the need to understand the interactions between classes and components.  If the system is simple and the interactions are obvious, then sequence diagrams may not be necessary.  For more information on sequence diagrams, see the [UML Sequence Diagrams](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/sequence-diagrams.html) page.  Both Mermaid and Lucidchart support sequence diagrams.
