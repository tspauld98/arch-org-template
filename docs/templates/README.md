# Template Content Directory

This directory is provided as a convenience.  It is the location to place any template artifacts that you are not currently using but that you do not want to delete.  Think of it as a "junk drawer" for your architecture documentation.  It is a place to put things that you might want to use later, but that you don't want to see in your main documentation structure.
