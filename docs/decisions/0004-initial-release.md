## Type

The type of the decision: **Design Approval**.

## Status

Approved

## Context

Whenever a design is declared complete, it is important to formally document the approval of the design in conjunction with its release.  This decision is to document the approval of the initial design of the Online Banking System.

## Decision

* The [initial release, v1.0.0](https://github.com/tspauld98/arch-organizer-template/releases/tag/v1.0.0), of the Online Banking System in the Architecture Organizer Template project is approved.

## Consequences

Versioning of the design will be managed using [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).  The version of the template and the version of the design are synominous since they are located in the same repository.  Any changes to the design or the template will require a new decision to be made in conjunction with its release superseding the decision documenting the previous version.
