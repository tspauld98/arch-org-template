# Deployment Diagram

## Purpose

The deployment diagram illustrates how the code is packaged and deployed into the production environment.  It is intended to provide a detailed view of all the system's packages and their run-time dependencies. Every general network interaction should be represented in the deployment diagram.  The primary audience for the deployment diagram is architects, lead engineers, and site reliability engineers.  The artifacts in the deployment diagram are at the `sea` level of abstraction.
