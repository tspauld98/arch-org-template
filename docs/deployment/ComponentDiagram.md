# Component Diagram

## Purpose

This diagram is intended to provide a deployment-level view of the system's components to indicate packaging.  The artifacts in the component diagram reflect the artifacts that should be seen in after a successful release build.  The audience for this artifact includes architects, engineers, site reliability engineers, and system administrators.  The artifacts in the component diagram are at the `sea` level of abstraction.

## Electivity

This section is considered:  **Optional**

## For More Information on Component Diagrams

While component diagrams can be critical to understand how a system works, they are often not necessary for every system.  The decision to include component diagrams should be based on the complexity of the packaging for the components of the system and the need to understand the component structure of the system by developers.  If the system is simple and the structure is obvious, then component diagrams may not be necessary.  For more information on component diagrams, see the [UML Component Diagrams](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/component-diagrams.html) page.  Mermaid does not currently support component diagrams, so they will need to be created using [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) or a similar tool.
